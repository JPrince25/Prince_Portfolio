        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Jacob actually. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Mathematics and
          Computer Science at Lewis University. But, for the personal stuff, I
          was born on November 28, 2001 in the town of Lockport, Illinois. Here
          I have stayed for the past 21 years with my parents: Glen and Jane. My
          father was once a carpenter before he changed his career to work for
          the Will County Highway Department. My mother works for Linly Designs
          as a floral designer but during her free time she can be found
          gardening professionally as she wants to open up a flower business for
          homegrown flowers. I'm an only child, but I consider my three best
          friends that I have known since Kindergarten to be my brothers. Joe
          also attends Lewis and is looking to dursue electrial engineer when he
          doesn't have a book underneath his nose. Cole was in the Marines
          before he had to be medically removed, now he is also pursuing an
          electrical engineering degree at the University of Iowa. Tom is still
          an active member of the Marines as a welder who has been away more on
          deployment. During our free time we can often be found playing some
          sort of video game or board game together as there is nothing better
          than a good game and good company. I also have been involved in
          volleyball for the past 11 years. I used to actually coach for my high
          school's JV boys' volleyball team until this spring. I'm still
          involved though as I do my best to be help to our women's volleyball
          team here at Lewis when I can.

        <h4>My Favorite Hobby</h4>
        <p>
          One of my favorite hobbies besides video games, is to read. Although I
          have a vast selection of classical literature, my main passion comes
          in the form of comic books. Ever since high school, I started to
          collect graphic novels for Batman, Nightwing, Batgirl, John
          Constantine, Moon Knight and Spider-Man. Now I have a massive shelf
          filled to the brim even after adding some manual attachments to it.
          Over the years I also been collecting specific issues that are either
          visually impressive, key moments in history, or the single issue forms
          of my favorite stories. The goal would be to eventually get frames for
          them to be displayed on the walls of my study.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for these stories and the media has driven me down a path
          where I would someday like to write and draw my own comic books. Of
          course, the idea is to follow some sort of computer science career,
          but on the side I want to hone my writing skills on the side. Who
          knows, I might be able to find a career where I will have to do both.
          That would be the dream.

        <h5>Fun Fact</h5>
        <p>
          Altough I do draw to prepare for those comics, I also like to express
          my creative side physically through props. Ever since I was in 3rd
          Grade, I had made my own halloween costume. That plus my father's
          workshop at my disposal, my mothers craft passion for going to Hobby
          Lobby, and a love for watching Adam Savage, made me actively create
          different props that I loved from movies, video games, and television.
          Granted, most of these projects go unfinished, I still enjoy doing it.
          My most recent builds have been Mjolnir, a wooden Geralt sword, a Moon
          Knight cloak, a Spider-Man type mask, a Gwent board, a Paddy's Pub
          sign for my cousin, and my "patent pending" towel poncho.

            <strong>
              Innovation 1 -

                FORTRAN (1954):
              </a>
            </strong>
            The devlopment of the first high-level language is significant
            because it set the precedent for modern day programming. FORTRAN
            being the origin of most modern day languages that we use today just
            highlights how important it was. I especially enjoy not having to
            write all of my code in Assembly.

                IBM Personal Computer (1981):
              </a>
            </strong>
            The release of the IBM Personal Computer also has to be another
            great innovation. It was one of the first real PC's that was
            massively sold. The plan to shift and create devices that have a
            more commercial purpose has paved the way for incentives of
            technological innovations for the consumer to be more considered.
            After all, I've been writing this website on my PC.

                Apple iPhone (2007):
              </a>
            </strong>
            The iPhone release is my final important innovation. As we move into
            the mobile age, there is more of an incentive to create mobile
            software for these devices that artificially connect us around the
            world. Without the iPhone, this may not have come to be. The
            touchscreen along with the ability to run applications on the phone
            are a staple of today's culture and functions. Imgagine having to go
            back to keypads now.
